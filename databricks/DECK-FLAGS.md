# Deck flags from the notes pass

Things the note writers found on the slides themselves while writing the read-alone
notes. The notes teach the correct reading; the slide images are untouched. For whoever
edits the Keynote sources. Page numbers are PDF pages.

## 05-unsupervised-learning
- p46: arrow labeled "Best number of clusters" points at K=6, the silhouette minimum; by the deck's own definition (p44) the best value is the maximum, K=2.
- p32: code reads `labels_f`, meant `labels_`.
- p47: figure title says MiniBatchKMeans, code passes `KMeans()`; `poof()` is `show()` in current Yellowbrick.
- p51: "dimensionality reduction loses no information" is stated unconditionally; the note scopes it.
- p49: worksheet slide; Worksheet 5.1 also covers agglomerative clustering and DBSCAN, which the deck does not.

## 08-deep-learning
- p11: perceptron attributed to "Minksy & Papert, 1969" and "McCulloh-Pitts"; Rosenblatt 1958 introduced it, Minsky and Papert 1969 analyzed its limits. Two misspellings.
- p12: weights "(1,-0,75,0.25)" for (1, -0.75, 0.25).
- p22: "gets their faster". p49: "utilize for gates" for "four gates".
- p42: library list (Theano, Torch, Lasagne, Caffe, Pylearn2, Chainer) is dated; the labs use Keras and PyTorch.
- p41, p50: notes describe the current worksheets; re-check if the notebooks change.

## 12-model-context-protocol
- p3: "we will built".
- p23: code string literal wraps mid-string on the slide.
- p20: bare pointer to https://ai.gtkcyber.com/mcp-lab with no description in the deck (UNRESOLVED note).
- Worksheet 12.1 markdown says "Module 12" and "Module 13" where it means Module 11 (notebook, not deck).
